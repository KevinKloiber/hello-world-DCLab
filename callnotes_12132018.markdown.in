Here is the list in english:

    1. Dyspnea and respiratory abnormalities
    2. General symptoms
    3. Other and unspecified injury to head face and neck
    4. Abdonimal pain / Other symptoms involving abdomen and pelvis
    5. Palindromic rheumatism
    6. Dysphagia
    7. Nontraumatic compartment syndrome / swelling of limb
    8. Other and unspecified disorders of back
    9. Acute, but ill-defined, cerebrovascular disease
    10. Other specified cardiac dysrhythmias


Here's also the TOP 10 of 5 digit ICD codes:

    ICD 5   Freq. Name
    786.09  13.3  Other respiratory abnormalities
    786.50  12.8% Chest pain, unspecified
    786.05  11.2% Shortness of breath
    780.79  7.4%  Other malaise and fatigue
    780.09  6.4%  Other alteration of consciousness
    780.02  6.0%  Transient alteration of awareness
    078.02  4.6%  Syncope and collapse
    789.00  4.5%  Abdominal pain, unspecified site
    780.97  3.9%  Altered mental status
    078.04  3.7%  Dizziness and giddiness

All in all, seems like plausible reasons to call an ambulance while not having super specific diagnostic codes.
