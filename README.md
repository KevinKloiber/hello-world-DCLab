Trying out how to set up a repository and how Github works.

Welcome to the first lesson of Git/Github!

Here you will learn how to set up repositorys, open a new branch, add commits and watch the magic happen. No more multiple file names!

You will also learn how to to pull requests, create forks and all that funny stuff.

Under Issues you can find new tasks but I think Projects is also really helpful and maybe issues is just helpful for really short term tasks?
